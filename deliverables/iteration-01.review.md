## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 09/Feb/2017
 * Where: room 2095 BA

## Process - Reflection

We debated about doing a sleeping application that helped people with insomnia. Although we had planned a significant amount already, we chose to do a Lost and Found application instead because a sleeping app produced the way we envision it would require significant amounts of verify scientific research which would require too much time for this team project.

In the review meeting, we all agreed that the Lost and Found app would be best and planned and discussed what features this app should include. We talked about the scope of this project in terms of our target audience and chose the University of Toronto for its manageable size and the fact that all members of the communication have a unique UTORID identifier.   


#### Decisions that turned out well

1. The biggest decision we made was switching our idea from making a Sleep Assist app to making a Lost and Found application.  It is a great decision because the target users for this app would be much wider, and it is also more realistic in terms of the balance between research and programming demands.

2. We also chose abandoned our very first idea of doing a Smart timetable application.  We feel it’s a smart decision because there already exists powerful timetable apps such as Griddy.  Therefore, we felt that a Smart timetable wouldn’t significantly contribute to what was already on the market.
 
3. As one of the features of our Lost and Found app, we discussed the possibility of implementing a messaging system to allow users to easily contact one another, however we decided to delay implementation of such a system until later development phases depending on the time available.  We believe this is the right thing to do because messaging is not the key feature for our application, and it would require a large amount of time to implement. 

We decided to include the following five features:

1. Lost Items Map:= The map will use the  Google maps API and SQL database queries to locate the lost items.  Because people lose items every day, the map would contain thousands of pins and become very difficult to use.  By having SQL searches we can restrict the amount of search result returned according to time period, geographic area, as well as details about the specific items lost such as colour, branding, and item model.

2. Basic Search:= Using Basic Search matches keywords to lost items using SQL and then lists the related items on postings.  The posts would have links to the user who found the item along with their Lost and Found email contact.  The Lost and Found application would act as a mediator between the two parties by have anonymous email messaging similar to companies such as Amazon and Kijiji.

3. User Records/Reviews:= As a way of protecting the integrity of the lost and found system, the app would record a user’s community interaction history through cataloging of interactions and honesty reviews provided by fellow users.  If someone fraudulently claims a lost item, as their own, users can report them and affect their History/honesty record.  This would alert other users of potential fraudulent activity and after three such reports, we may delete their account and restrict them from having contact with other users.

4. Serial Code Matching System:= Although we are still discussing the best way to incorporate this into our app.  We hope to implement measures where users can catalogue their valuables into the system/their account.  By having a unique identifier on goods, should an item become lost, the ability match a lost item with a found item would be much easier and the parties involved can be sure who the real owner is.  Such a feature would also bring in users who worry about the security of their goods rather than just those who have lost something and are now looking to get it back.


5. User-to-user Messaging:= This a additional feature we might do in a later phase, it will allow users to communicate in real time in order to better arrange a meeting time and place.  The Messaging system may also facilitate users who lose something in a public space like at a festival and allow them to perhaps find the item while there are still in the area.e.:

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

The decisions we felt that didn’t turn our well are mainly related to our Sleep Assist application:
1. We the idea of using nature sounds for our sleeping app, but after talking about it with one another and our TA, we agreed that there are already plenty existing products out there which offer the same functionality.

2. Also related to our Sleep Assist application, we hoped to implement the ability to post sleep related questions to a forum but in retrospect, such information can easily available found through Google searches and other websites related to sleep and medicine.

3. Similarly, we had an English keyboard idea for a project idea. It proved to be not as good since after some research, we found the market to be flooded with many types of keyboards that had similar styles and functionality to the one we hoped to make.


#### Planned changes

We changed our project from a Sleep Assist app to a Lost and Found app. We feel the Lost and Found concept is better because our target audience will broader and cover most demographics.  We also feel there are lots of interesting features that we can implement into our app that isn’t currently available in existing products.

Originally, we planned our target audience as people living and working in Toronto, but later decided to change it to the University of Toronto community. We feel that our first project iteration should be easy to manage and test.  The University of Toronto is large enough to provide a significant sample testing size and not so large that we would be overwhelmed by the amount of data we would have to deal with.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

Our biggest goal was finalizing our project idea.  When choosing between the ideas of Sleep Assist app and the Lost and Found app are came to agreement with each other and TA.  We also agreed on what would be best as the basic features our app and discussed our next steps.  In addition, we ranked our features according to priority of with features need to be addressed first.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We intend to do some research for the map implementation because we are not sure if we can use the Google API and if it is possible, the best way to implement it.  We also plan to do some research in terms of keyword search capabilities with SQL.  Due to shortage of time, we have yet completed those tasks.

## Meeting Highlights

We discuss in length the best way to implement our serial matching system, we are going to do further research and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of all options.  Messaging feature may be discussed later since it may be hard to implement.  We would like to currently focus all of our resources on the core functionality of the our application.  We are also considering User Credit system.  With such a system, users can look up posting from users who have lost an item.   Those users looking up the postings can take on the task of searching for the lost item and either returning it to user or connect the person who lost the item with the person who found the time.  In exchange, the user would receive ‘User Credits’ which would provide them the benefits of advanced functionality on the application such as posting of their own lost items getting priority rankings in searches.
