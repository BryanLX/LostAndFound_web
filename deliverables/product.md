-# LOST-AND-FOUND-APP/TBD (Talented Brilliant Developer)


 -#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 A Lost and Found Mobile App 


 We found a problem for the current lost and found system in U of T, that is,
 whenever you lose something, you have to go to the lost and found centre to
 check whether your lost item is there. It is common that you go to the lost
 and found station but unable to get any useful information.


 ============ What feature our app contains ====================

 (0). Registration and login.

        Basically you need to register and log in before you can use any feature
      in the lost and found app. We need to make sure that all the information
      inside our lost and found app are reliable and all the people who find
      the lost item or declared an lost item can be tracked.


 (1). Searching Algorithm.

        We provide an searching algorithm for people to search their lost items.
      They can search based on the keywords , if the keywords matched with some
      item found by other people, some very limited information will be showed.
      For example: a phone found in the train station . If someone found some lost
      items, they can post a found information, give it some very limited keywords
      such as the location ,time they found the item and what is the general type
      of that item.

 (2). Serial number

        If you don't want some valuable item to lose but you just don't want to
      attach your personal information onto it. We can produce a serial number
      for this item related to your account. If you attach the serial number to
      that item, it will help you find it when it gets lost. Of course, when
      people search some serial number that doesn't belong to them, nothing
      but the owner of that item will be shown.

 (3). History Recording.

        Record all the history of one's activity in the lost and found app, such
        as some report that they found some items or someone declares that the
        item belong to them.


 (4). Map Area selection.

        If too many items are shown when you use the keywords to find your lost
        items. You can select the location where your item lost there. This will
        help you navigate the number of shown items, making it easier for you to
        find your lost item. But again, very limited information are shown while
        your are searching for security.

 (5). Link to the lost and found station in U of T.







 -#### Q2: Who are your target users?

      Our target users is the students and the lost and found
      station in University of Toronto.







 -#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?


      (1) Save the time of the owner of the lost property:

            If people lost some items which doesn't contain any personal information,
            they need to go the the lost and found station in person to check whether
            their lost items lie there. If they can use our lost and found app, they
            can use it to link the lost and found station and search the lost item based
            on some keywords to detect whether they have the necessary to go to the
            lost and found station.

      (2) Provide more information for the owner of the lost property:

            For example, If you lost a phone near the train station, you can search
            whether there is a phone found near the train station on some specific
            time. This gives people reliable information whether their lost item are
            probably found.

      (3) Security:

            Whenever you search based on some keywords, very limited information of
            the related item will be showed to you. This is out of the consideration
            that people declare something doesn't belong to them. If a person declares
            something, they need to provide the matched information of that lost items
            to the person who found it.

      (4) Accuracy:

            We use the time, location, general type and other limited information as
            keywords for the search functionality. This can help people navigate the
            number of items that are likely to be owned by them they need to check.







 -### Highlights


  Our team had discussed over several choices besides the lost and found app, such as the sleeping app,
the course manager app, the typewriting app, the command-line emailing function, and also an mobile app
that monitored the time a user spent on any phone app. 

We considered to build a sleeping app which will include natural sound like rain, wind to help people 
relax, we even considered to add social function to make it different from other similar apps. 
But then we think this sleeping app doesn't need to have a social function, and it's similar to other sleeping apps. 
So we give up on it.

For the course manager app, we found a really nice course planner website, which have almost all the functionalities we want, 
so we give it up. 

Finally, we dicide to build a lost and found app, since it can help more people and more practical. It can improve the efficiency
of current lost and found system on campus and we can also add really nice features like add serial code to our items. So we decide to 
choose this as our project
