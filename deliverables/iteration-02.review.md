 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

2017-03-09 BA2195, we met in person.

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

We plan to build an Android App before, but we found out it is very hard to be familiar with Android Studio in a short time, so we make a lost and found website at last since it's easier
to learn HTML, CSS and javascript.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1.	We give all our team members a few days to learn Android Studio and then see can we handle it. After a few days, we found we have lots of troubles and cannot make it. So we discussed and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript together and build a website at last. We haven’t wasted too many time on Android and quickly decide to make a website. This is important to us since we can finish our work on time at last.
2.	We plan to finish our front end first. It’s a relatively easier job and is finished very quickly. But then we have lots of troubles in our backend, all of us help and finish all the tasks on time.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1.	Just have a few days to learn Android Studio. The time is so limited and we cannot handle Android Studio at last. We should plan it earlier and learn it earlier. 
2.	Assign same amount of members to frontend and backend. Since later we find our frontend work is much easier than backend when we plan to build a website. We need to learn different types of JavaScript and SQL to build a database and this takes a lot of time.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

1.	We plan to make an Android App first, but we build a website at last. The reason is that we underestimate the difficulties of Android Studio and the amount of work to build a mobile app. We don’t have any experience of Android app but two of our team members have experience to build a website. So we learn lots of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and decide to build a website at last.




## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

[1.	Finished all our frond end work.](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-24/blob/master/Iteration-02.plan.md)
[2.	Finished basic function (get data, add data) from our database.](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-24/blob/master/Iteration-02.plan.md)
[3.	Connect our front end to our back end.](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-24/blob/master/Iteration-02.plan.md)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

1.There are some problems when we connect from front-end to our back-end. For example: after log in, sometimes our page will direct to a wired location in our local computer. It should be some problem in our javascript file. We will fix it later.

2.Our database sometimes return wrong info. We need to modify our database and website code.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

1.	Make sure front end will give correct response every time and our database will return correct info every time.
2.	Implement a better search algorithm to make our website more efficient to use.
3.	Complete our serial code part, users can generate serial code for their valuable items and stick it on their items like bottles, laptops… When they lost items, they can search serial code to see if their items are found by others.
