Product: Lost and Found App

Team Name: TBD (this is literally our team name, Talented Brilliant Developers)

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Feb. 3rd
 * End date: Feb. 9th

## Process

Quick introduction:

  In this intial planning meeting, we discussed the topic that we would implement in the future. 

#### Roles & responsibilities
Manager: Build frames and coordinate different classes

Designer: Responsible for front end UI design

Coder: Responsible for back end code

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 Feb. 3rd in BA to brainstorm different ideas to implement in the future.
 Choose ideal topic during the meeting.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   
   We write down all the ideas team members come up with during the meeting. Then we choose 2 of them and send the ideas to TA to get the feedback. Based on the feedback we will decide which one to implement eventually.
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   
   The highest priority would be brainstorm as many ideas as possible and narrow down the range. Then getting enough feedback is the next must-do.
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   
   Everyone get involved in the brainstorm process. Then the owners of two ideas that we choose in the end describe their ideas detailly and send them to TA. When we get feedbacks, everyone discuss which one is the final idea.

#### Goals and tasks
 
 GOAL #1: Design user login system. Each user has their account and password stored in the system. And every time
 
 they open the app they will see a login page. New user will be led to a page where they can create there account 
 
 with their utorid and email address.
 
     TASK 1: design a database that stores user information.
     
     TASK 2: design the login page.
     
     TASK 3: design user account creation page. (Can create both admin and user)
     
     TASK 4: design user account page for user to edit their account information.
     
     TASK 5: design account types: user, admin.
     
 
 GOAL #2: Design a keyword matching system as main searching system. User can search lost items by providing basic 
 
 description of their item. User will finish the description by filling in a form. User can create a picked item 
 
 in the system by filling a similar form.
 
     TASK 5: design a database that stores item information.
     
     TASK 6: design a key word matching algorithm and define the list of information required in the form.
     
     TASK 7: design a item creation page.
     
     TASK 8: design a item search page.
     
     TASK 9: design a result page that will display the searching result and display the result using a certain order.
     
     TASK 10: design a searching algorithm.
     
     TASK 11: design the functionailty to remove the picked items.
     
GOAL #3: Design a id code generation system. For each item user owned, user can generate a special code for it. (Unique for

each item). System will store the code and the item into the system. The item will the code will be linked to user account.

User can link or unlink the code. Design the logo in this GOAL as well.

    TASK 12: design logo.
    
    TASK 13: design code generation system.
    
    TASK 14: design a database to store item that belongs to user.
    
    TASK 15: add the serial code to the keyword matching searching algorithm.
    
    TASK 16: add the serial code searching option into searching page.
    
    TASK 17: design the code generation interface that can be accessed in user account page. This includes link and unlink.
    
GOAL #4: Design a history record system. This system will record all pick items and where it goes. (For admin access only)

    TASK 18: design the history record database.
    
    TASK 19: design the searching algorithm. 
    
    TASK 20: design the access permission. For admin only.
    
    TASK 21: design a history access request for normal user. (If they think the item is given to non-owners). Admin will
    
    see this request through a request page. 
    
GOAL #5: Design a map system that will display lost items without a code in a district.

    TASK 22: build the map interface.
    
    TASK 23: design the distrct areas and provide zoom functionality.
    
    TASK 24: design the pins for each lost items displayed on the map.
    
    TASK 25: design a algorithm to display limited information about the lost item on the map.
    
    TASK 26: display each lost and found center on the map and marked them as special districts. 
    
GOAL #6: Design a live chat system that can send messages in the systems.

    TASK 26: design the chat interface page.
    
    TASK 27: design the chat system.
    
GOAL #7: Design a credit system that will give user who successully return the item back to the owner. Owner will be able to

post a request to look for a item with credit. (Still need to discuss how the credit system actuall works)

    TASK 28: design the idea of credit system and its rules.
    
    TASK 29: build the credit system functionality inside application. 
    
GOAL #8: Design a riddle system (not determined): To display information about lost items, instead of display the explict type

of the lost item, system will "encrypt" the type of the item into a riddle. A riddle has to satisfy: a. short. b. easily be

understood by user who are aware of what is the lost item. Use can submit riddles into system.
    
    TASK 30: design the pratical examples of riddles.
    
    DO THE FOLLOWING TASKS ONLY IF TASK 30 IS COMPLETED.
    
        TASK 30.1: design the riddle database.
        
        TASK 30.2: design the riddle submmission page.

    
    

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
   
   ARTIFACT #1: LOGO of the application.
   
       A must have artifact to become popular.
       
   ARTIFACT #2: Build all the page interfaces described in above tasks.
   
       These pages supports that basic functionality of each goals.
