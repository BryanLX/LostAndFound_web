Focusing largely on features of the app rather than the problem you’re solving. 
Why is it that you don’t get any useful information when you go to lost found? 
What kind of information do they give you? Why are the features you’re building important?
Target users are very broad-- students encompass many different groups. 
For the lost and found group, this just seems like a lot more work to manage than a desk. 
Why is this going to be useful for them? Did you talk to any users at all?


Plan

Please remove the writing prompts given to you in the template for these documents. It is very confusing to read. 
Your response to how you track what gets done/prioritize tasks/assign tasks doesn’t make a lot of sense in the grand scheme beyond deciding on an idea. 
Why is login system your highest priority? Why is the most important artifact a logo? This is really trivial.


Review

Lots of grammatical errors. Good reflection of why you chose this project over the others, would have liked to see more decision around the current project than the previous ones. 
Try to talk to users when making design decisions rather than just pulling them out of the air.



Overall quality

Formatting is difficult to read at times. Leaving the writing prompts is also confusing. 
Does not feel like a professional document. Lots of grammatical errors as well.
