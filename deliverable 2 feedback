Video                   2               Background music is super distracting. 
                                        I understand the workflow, but not the value proposition. 
                                        Why would anyone create an account + publicize their contact info just because they found a wallet??
                                        I have no idea what a serial code is or why it is important.
                                        
iteration-02.plan.md    2               What are the responsibilities associated with these roles? WHy did you assign these people to these roles particularly?
                                        Process is pretty vague
                                        Lacking artifacts, please review what artifacts are meant to be
                                        
iteration-02.review.md  1               Why did you prioritize the front end? It seems the back end is more important to me
                                        Over this iteration, the only significant decision you acknowledged was moving away from Android? Thatâ€™s basically what this whole document communicates to me.
